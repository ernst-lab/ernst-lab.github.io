Much of my research is focused on developing and applying software for
characterizing and visualizing patterns of RNA editing among mammalian
transcriptomes. High-throughput genomic technologies have revealed that millions
of loci throughout the human genome are potentially under the control of RNA
editing, a form of transcriptional regulation whereby RNA sequence is changed
from its original DNA sequence. Using non-human models and comparative genomics,
I am uncovering new roles of RNA editing in novel models and providing new
insight into how RNA editing may have shaped mammalian evolution.
