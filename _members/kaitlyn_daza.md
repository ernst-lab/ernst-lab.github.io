I’m currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Animal Science’s Animal Breeding and Genetics Group, and a recipient of the USDA NIFA National Needs Fellowship (2013 – 2016). I earned a B.S. in Animal Science from MSU in 2013, and my previous research experience studied dairy cattle feeding behavior at the William H. Miner Agricultural Research Institute in Chazy, NY (Summer 2013). My current research focuses on understanding the effects of microRNA regulation on meat quality and carcass phenotypes in pigs utilizing GWAS, regulatory network analysis, and molecular genetics techniques. When I’m not working on research, I enjoy spending time with my husband, friends, and family, and adventuring new parks and trails with my dog, Willow.
