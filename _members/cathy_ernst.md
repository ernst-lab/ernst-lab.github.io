I started my research program at MSU in 1997 and I am currently a professor of Animal Science.  I also hold a partial administrative appointment as Director of the MSU interdepartmental Genetics Graduate Program.  Nationally, I serve as Pig Genome Co-Coordinator for the USDA National Animal Genome Research Program (NRSP-8), and I serve as a Section Editor for the Journal of Animal Science. Before starting my faculty position, I received my MS from Iowa State University and my PhD from The Ohio State University, and did postdoctoral research at the USDA Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center, NE. In addition to research, I teach an undergraduate genetics course, an undergraduate biotechnology seminar, and a graduate scientific writing course. Outside of work, I am chauffeur for my teenage daughter, and spend many hours sitting at band performances.
