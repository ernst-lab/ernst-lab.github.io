I have been the lab manager for the Ernst lab since 1997 and am also lab manager for two other faculty members. I received my BS and MS from the University of Kentucky. In addition to conducting research, I am responsible for overseeing the routine functioning of the laboratory as well as training students. When I’m not at work, I’m busy trying to keep up with my four-year old twin girls.
