My current research involves integrating genome-wide association studies, transcriptomic profiling, and network analyses to identify genetic-variant dependent gene expression in swine adipose tissue, as well as molecular mechanisms governing fat deposition. My other interests include long distance running, traveling, and solving puzzles of all varieties.
