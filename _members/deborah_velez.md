I am a PhD candidate of Animal Science, Breeding and Genetics Group. I completed my Masters Degree in 2012 at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus and was awarded a USDA NIFA National Needs Fellowship to pursue a PhD at Michigan State University. My research at Puerto Rico focused on identifying genetic markers within the bovine calpastatin and calpain genes in commercial cattle and their association with meat quality phenotypes. At MSU I research quantitative methods for high throughput transcriptional profiling to uncover the genetic control of gene expression variation in our pig resource population. Through the use of expression QTL mapping and allele specific expression we aim to identify local and distant regulators of gene expression that show joint association to complex trait phenotypes.
