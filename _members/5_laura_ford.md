I am currently an undergraduate Animal Science major with minors in Conservation, Recreation, and Environmental Enforcement 
and Sustainable Natural Resource Recreation Management. My research involves identification of novel pig microRNAs involved 
in skeletal muscle development. In my free time I enjoy wildlife rehabilitation and spending time with my friends and cat, 
Izzy.
