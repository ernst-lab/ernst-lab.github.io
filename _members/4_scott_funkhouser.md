Much of my thesis research is focused on developing and applying software for
characterizing and visualizing patterns of RNA editing among mammalian transcriptomes,
revealing a wealth of under-studied single nucleotide variation that may be used
to explain phenotypic variation. Additionally my research involves developing
new methods for prediction of complex traits from existing sources of common 
genetic variants. In my free time I enjoy golfing, finding new restaurants,
learning more about programming and web design, and rooting for Seattle sports teams.
