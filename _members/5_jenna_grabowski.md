I am currently an undergraduate Animal Science major. My research involves profiling the expression of genes of interest in cultured mouse skeletal muscle cells to define their effects on myogenesis. In my free time, I enjoy running, attending Spartan sporting events, running sled dogs, and spending time with my friends.
