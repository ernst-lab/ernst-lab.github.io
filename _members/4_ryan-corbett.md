The majority of my research involves analyzing whole-genome DNA methylation patterns in pig adult and fetal tissues to enhance discovery of regulatory elements. My other projects involve studying RNA editing dynamics during pig development, as well as how the pig epigenome is impacted by stressors experienced in production environments. I am currently funded under a USDA NIFA National Needs Training Grant. Additionally, I am actively involved in genetics-related community outreach in the Greater Lansing area. In my free time, I am usually triathlon training or sitting on my couch with a book or crossword puzzle.
