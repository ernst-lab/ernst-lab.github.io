The majority of my research involves analyzing whole-genome DNA methylation patterns in pig adult and fetal tissues to enhance discovery of regulatory elements and increase functional annotation of the porcine genome. My other projects involve studying RNA editing dynamics during pig development, as well as how the epigenome of livestock species is impacted by stressors experienced in production settings. I have previously been funded under a USDA NIFA National Needs Training Grant (2016-Spring 2019), and I am currently funded by a USDA NIFA Predoctoral Fellowship. Additionally, I am actively involved in genetics-related community outreach and engagement in the Greater Lansing area. In my free time, I am usually triathlon training or sitting on my couch with a book or crossword puzzle.
