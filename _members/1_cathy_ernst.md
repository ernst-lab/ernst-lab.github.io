I started my research program at MSU in 1997 and I am currently a professor of Animal Science. I also hold partial administrative appointments as Associate Chair for Graduate Training and Research in the Department of Animal Science, and as Director of the MSU interdepartmental Genetics and Genome Sciences Graduate Program. Nationally, I serve as Pig Genome Co-Coordinator for the USDA National Animal Genome Research Program (NRSP-8). Before starting my faculty position, I received my MS from Iowa State University and my PhD from The Ohio State University, and did postdoctoral research at the USDA Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center, NE. In addition to research, I co-teach an undergraduate genetics course, and I facilitate a graduate scientific writing course and a graduate seminar course.
