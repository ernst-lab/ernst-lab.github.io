Among the complex ways in which animals can regulate the expression of transcripts, endogenous RNA editing has been shown to be widespread, catalyzed primarily by the nuclear expressed family of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) proteins that perform single adenosine to inosine transitions along premature RNA transcripts. It remains unknown to what degree transcriptome-wide RNA editing exists in livestock species and its overall effect on controlling complex traits. We have built bioinformatic software to streamline the RNA editing detection process from whole genome sequencing and RNA-seq data and have begun to apply it to the pig model, observing inherent associations between candidate RNA editing sites and swine-specific SINE retrotransposons. We are evaluating the stability and repeatability of RNA edited sites among pigs, as well as assessing the spatial and temporal variation of edited sites. This work is crucial to understanding the extent to which RNA editing contributes to single nucleotide variation among swine transcriptomes, and how this unique mechanism of transcriptional regulation contributes to complex phenotypes.
