Epigenetic processes result in heritable changes in gene expression without changes in DNA sequence. DNA methylation—the most studied epigenetic modification to DNA—involves the enzymatic addition of a methyl group to cytosine bases in DNA, and in mammals occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides. CpG methylation at proximal and distal gene regulatory regions—including promoters, enhancers, and insulators—is strongly associated with transcription, and as such has been shown to play important roles in tissue-specific gene expression, early development, and genomic imprinting. DNA methylation patterns in mammals are also heavily influenced by environmental perturbations; aberrant DNA methylation in response to stressors has been associated with adverse life outcomes. The Ernst lab is currently using Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) to assess DNA methylation patterns across a diverse set of adult and fetal pig tissues as a means to identify novel sites of transcriptional regulation. The lab also utilizes WGBS and array-based platforms to assess methylation dynamics in immune cells of pigs in response to stressors, as well as in human tissue samples of patients with psychiatric disorders.
