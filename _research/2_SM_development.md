The Ernst lab has had a long-term research interest in the mechanisms that control skeletal muscle growth and development. Development, growth and function of skeletal muscle are dynamic processes. Skeletal muscle ultimately becomes meat, the product of pig production, and skeletal muscle accounts for 40-65% of carcass weight. The number of muscle fibers in pigs, as well as most mammals, is determined prenatally. Development of skeletal muscle fibers during fetal development occurs in two waves during which myoblasts proliferate and fuse to form new fibers. Primary fibers form de novo and secondary fibers form around primary fibers. In pigs these processes take place at approximately 30-60 and 54-90 days of gestation, respectively. Our lab has collected skeletal muscle samples from an ontogeny of fetal and post-natal ages. RNA from these samples has been evaluated for transcript abundance and differential expression between ages using expression microarrays and real time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Ongoing work on this project involves examining transcript abundance using RNA-seq and microRNA-seq, as well as applying whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and other epigenetic approaches to further annotate the skeletal muscle transcriptome.
