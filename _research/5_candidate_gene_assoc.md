Our lab uses several different pig populations to evaluate genetic variation associated with candidate genes. Most of the genes we study are selected based on their map position within regions of quantitative trait loci (QTL) identified for phenotypic traits in our Duroc x Pietrain resource population. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes are either identified in our lab or obtained from the literature, and SNP genotypes are associated with phenotypes. Recent genes that we have evaluated include IGFBP2, CRHR2, PRKAG3 and LEPR. For some genes, we also evaluate transcript abundance in longissimus dorsi muscle, subcutaneous fat and/or liver samples from our resource population pigs.
