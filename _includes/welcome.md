The Animal Molecular Genetics Laboratory focuses on identification and evaluation of genes and genetic markers associated with genetic improvement of production traits in pigs and other meat animal species.  Much of our research is at the interface of structural and functional genomics, including a genetical genomics project to integrate genetic marker and gene expression data to identify genes controlling skeletal muscle and fat deposition, and their relationship to growth, carcass composition and meat quality in pigs.  This effort applies both RNAseq and miRNAseq approaches in order to reveal gene regulatory networks and pathways.  The lab also uses functional genomics approaches including transcriptome sequencing to study pig skeletal muscle development, and stress response in pigs.  Recent efforts also include discovery of RNA editing sites in the transcriptomes of various pig tissues, and assessment of DNA methylation patterns in pig and human tissues.
