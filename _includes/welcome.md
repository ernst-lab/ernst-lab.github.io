### Welcome to the Animal Molecular Genetics Lab!

The overall goal of the Animal Molecular Genetics Laboratory is to identify and evaluate molecular markers and genes for the genetic improvement of pigs and beef cattle with emphasis on performance traits, carcass composition and meat quality. Current projects include a genetical genomics projects in pigs that involve integration of genetic marker and gene expression data for identifying genes controlling skeletal muscle and fat deposition and their relationship to growth, carcass merit and meat quality traits. Additional projects include identification of differentially expressed genes in developing pig skeletal muscle, transcriptional profiling of pigs infected with PRRS virus, and evaluation of behavior and temperament traits and their association with production traits in beef cattle and pigs. These projects are in collaboration with Drs. Juan Steibel, Ron Bates and Joan Lunney (USDA-ARS BARC, leader of the PRRS Host Genetics Consortium), as well as other colleagues at MSU, throughout the US, and in Brazil, Thailand, Korea and China.
